# Design Document

## System Architecture
<!-- The system will be a Python script that uses the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping, the mysql-connector-python library for database operations, and built-in Python libraries for terminal output. -->

## Data Models
<!-- The system will store course names and completion percentages in a MySQL database. Each course will be represented as a row in a table, with columns for the course name and completion percentage. -->

## Interfaces
<!-- The system will use the terminal for user interaction. It will display a text-based progress bar or a more complex ASCII art visualization. -->

## Algorithms
<!-- The system will use the BeautifulSoup library's parsing functions to extract course completion percentages from the website's HTML. -->

## Managing project documentation

<!-- Managing a project involves various types of documentation. Here are some documents that you might find useful for Python project: -->

<!-- 1. **Project Proposal**: This document outlines the purpose and scope of the project. It includes the project's objectives, deliverables, timeline, and resources required.

2. **Requirements Document**: This document details what the project is supposed to achieve. It includes functional requirements (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (how the system should perform).

3. **Design Document**: This document describes how the system will be structured to meet the requirements. It includes details about the system's architecture, data models, interfaces, and algorithms.

4. **Project Plan**: This document outlines the tasks needed to complete the project, who will do each task, and when each task is due. It often includes a Gantt chart or other type of schedule.

5. **Sprint Plan**: In Agile development, work is divided into short, iterative cycles called sprints. A sprint plan outlines the work to be done in each sprint.

6. **Test Plan**: This document outlines how the system will be tested to ensure it meets the requirements. It includes details about the types of tests to be performed, test cases, and test schedules.

7. **User Documentation**: This document provides instructions for end users on how to use the system. It often includes tutorials, FAQs, and troubleshooting information.

8. **Technical Documentation**: This document provides information for developers and other technical stakeholders. It often includes code comments, API documentation, and system configuration instructions.

9. **Meeting Minutes**: These documents provide a record of decisions made and actions agreed upon during project meetings.

10. **Change Log**: This document tracks changes made to the project over time, including new features, bug fixes, and updates. -->

<!-- Remember, the specific documents you need might vary depending on the nature of your project, the development methodology you're using (e.g., Agile, Waterfall), and your team's preferences. Happy coding! ðŸš€ -->
